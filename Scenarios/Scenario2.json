        "Hey Doctor, thanks for taking my call. I’ve got little Pai Rexia, a 10 day-old male who is coming in with a fevers to Tmax 103.1F and poor feeding. He was born at 39w3d and there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. He was discharged home at 2 days of life and doing great at that point. Over the last few days, his parents say that he’s been more sleepy and less interested in eating. His pediatrician has noticed that he’s not gained weight in the last 4 days, so they started supplementing with formula. Then he started having fevers last night, so his parents brought him in. He looks pretty sick and I’m worried because we don’t have any pediatricians here. "
